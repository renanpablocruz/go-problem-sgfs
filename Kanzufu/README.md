Taken from UliGo website.

This collection consists of almost 1500 problems; its Japanese name is Kanzufu, in Korean it is called Gwan Ja Bo. I removed the Chinese comments from the respective files on the Flygo website and put all the single problems into three large SGF files (part 1,2,3). So in principle these problems can be used with uliGo. Be advised, though, that these problems are quite hard: you might have to use the 'show solution' button quite often. Furthermore, the SGF files contain only one correct solution; since towards the end of the solution, a change in the order of moves is often possible, it can happen that although you found a correct solution, it is not accepted by uliGo because it is not in the SGF file.

But whichever way you choose to study these problems, I assure you that you will learn something and enjoy them.
