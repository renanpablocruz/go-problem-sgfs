AB[cc][dd][df][kc]AW[db][fc][ic]TR[kc]MA[dj]LB[fd:C][gc:A][gd:D][ge:F][hc:B][hd:E]C[Black would like to develop on the left side.  He could extend to the point marked, but before he does there are some forcing plays he can make against the white group, especially given the presence of the marked black stone.   How should black force white before extending on the left side, starting with one of the moves A to F.]

;W[dj]LB[fd:A]C[WRONG This leaves the weakness at A and ends in gote, letting white play on left side.  If black were more interested in the top side on the right, this wouldn't necessarily be a bad way to play. This problem, however, assumes black is interested in the left side.]
)

(

;W[fd]LB[dj:A]C[WRONG White could play on left at A since black's stones were not really sente.  This sequence only helps white, and black has little continuity among his stones.]
