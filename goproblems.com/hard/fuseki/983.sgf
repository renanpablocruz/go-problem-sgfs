C[Black has moyo on the upper side, and will now want to approach white's 3-3 stone.  What is white's best move?]

C[RIGHTBlack is forced to approach from the left side to defend his lone stone on the bottom, white can expand up the right side, countering a possible extension from black's shimari in the upper right.]

C[Close but no, this leaves white oppen at the bottom when black extends, and another move would be inefficient.]

C[Wrong direction, although it splits the marked stone from the moyo on top, black can still make an approach at a, and after white responds, black can extend to b, threatening whites lower left shimari.  Black is left with a solid foundation on the bottom, splitting white, leaving the right side without a substantial moyo.]
