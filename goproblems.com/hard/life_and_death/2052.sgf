C[RIGHT
White cannot connect at A, because black with B will capture
at either C or D.  But black A not only connects his groups,
it also threatens double-atari at C and D.  White must spend
a move (lost sente) to protect her four stones or give 8 points to black.]

The chinese text mentioned that this is variation is the strongest response white can give against black 1.  This is the text (translated) quote, 'Although black connects, but white 2 and 4 have gained benefit.'  I am not sure how white 2 and 4 have gained benefit.]
