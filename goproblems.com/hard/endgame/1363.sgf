C[5 points for black. the same as the correct solution. but black can exchange a for b, making this 2/3 of a point worse for white. (a ko with no further implications is worth 1/3 of a point, because one side needs 1 move to connect, and the other side needs 2 moves to capture and connect, making it 1 point for 3 moves)]
