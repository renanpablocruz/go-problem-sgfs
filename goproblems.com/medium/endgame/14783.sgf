(;W[ro]C[Locally this is a good answer, but you could do slightly better ;-)])
(;W[sn];B[sq];W[sp];B[rh]C[Now you still have to add one more stone to your territory, so you end with seven points only. One point worse than the solution plus black takes the ko.])
(;W[sp];B[rh]C[You will still have to play S5 and have seven points only, one point plus the ko worse than the solution.])
(;W[sq]C[Locally correct, keeping eight points.. but you could do a bit better with the ko :)])
(;W[rh]C[Yes, black T5 was just a neutral point. No matter what black plays in the white group nex tit will be always possible to live with eight points :)RIGHT]))
