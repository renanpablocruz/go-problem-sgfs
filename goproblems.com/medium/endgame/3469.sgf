equal in value to a gote move worth 14 points. When black has an alternative reply to 'F' of 9 to 15 points, it is 
bigger than the large monkey jump at 'L'. If 'C' is worth 8 points or less, or equals 16 points, first moves 'L' and 'S' allow the same best result. If 'C' is worth 17 points or more, 'L' is 1 point bigger than 'S'.])
