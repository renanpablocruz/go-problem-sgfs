C[RIGHT You won by 1. Due to it's big followup move at 'F', the small monkey jump into this corner formation at 'S', is 
equal in value to a gote move worth 14 points. When black has an alternative reply to 'F' of 9 to 15 points, it is 
bigger than the large monkey jump at 'C9'. If 'C' is worth 8 points or less, or equals 16 points, first moves 'C9' and 'S' allow the same best result. If 'C' is worth 17 points or more, 'C9' is 1 point bigger than 'S'.])

worth 9 to 15 points. If 'C' is worth 8 points or less, or equals 16 points, first moves 'L' and 'S' allow
