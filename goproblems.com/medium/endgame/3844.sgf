C[RIGHT You won by 1, the best result. The 17 point threat is just big enough to 
make 1st move 'I', better than the large monkey jump (L). The smaller ko threat (which must be at least 12 points) is required, to stop white answering the 
large ko threat and then playing 'C11' (after black takes the ko) which prevents black filling. It appears that the only time 'I' is a better move than 'L' into this formation, 
is when there are 2 ko threats (one 17 point or greater, the other 12 point or greater) to back it up; and even then, playing it costs sente. ------------------TO SUMMARISE: YOU 
NEED SERIOUS KO THREAT ADVANTAGE TO MAKE 'I' BETTER THAN 'L' INTO THIS FORMATION.])

C[You lost by 1, 2 points worse than the solution. Your 3rd move should have been at G10, so that white could not afford to lose the ko. This would have allowed a 1 point win, as 
black has sufficient ko threat advantage (one of 17 points, and another of over 11).])
