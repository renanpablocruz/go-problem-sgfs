C[White should´t play here (compare the B a4, W h2 path), but even this proves the black move wrong: Black E9 and he has gotten only 2 points in gote. The lower left is bigger. 
And if Black tenuki (plays elsewhere) he has gained nothing on the upper side (actually he lost something there).

C[Black has catched himself just in time and changed his play to the correct
place (H2). Both players should have played there instead of A and B at the
problem start. You got it right. Just proceed for 2 or 3 moves. ]
(;B[ae];W[ea];B[da];W[fa];B[ag]
C[RIGHT
None of the players could avoid the ko at a3.
Now you see why H2 is the only correct move in the lower right. This way white
has only one ko threat at d8 (the c9 threat later is too small). So black wins this
ko (he has a threat himself at f6) and thus the game.
