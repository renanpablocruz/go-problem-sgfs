C[RIGHT This move is almost totally worthless, 
although it does create a half eye in gote (A). 
Black was probably bored out of his mind with 
this game, as White hardly has any territory to 
speak of. Probably Black either wanted to hint 
that it was time for White te resign or decided 
to make the game more interesting by 
effectively giving White 2 moves in a row. Not 
that it mattered much anyway. White resigned 
at move 155.]
