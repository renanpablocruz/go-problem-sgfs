On the pincer he reacts with the corner-invasion of W3 and follows the common joseki up to B12. The white cut (stone marked with the square) now tries to make the situation difficult. But it's an overplay. Punish him! :-)This situation can occur in many variations it is important here, that black has some stones in the are already, like C12 here.]AP[goproblems]
