As long as A5 is open, A2 and A3 are miai, so Black lives and has more points than White.]

Keep in mind that when White plays A5, Black must make two eyes with A3 or A2. -- otherwise, W-A3, B-B3, W-A2 kills Black.]

A bit round-about, but in the end it works.
B8 is better than B9 in principle, because it doesn't create a ko threat for White.]
