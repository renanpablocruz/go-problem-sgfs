If you notice anything that isn't right, such as a bad move by white or a better solution to the problem, be sure to add a comment and let me know. Thanks and good luck.]

This is the best result for black and the most difficult for white; white could treat this as a two step ko and make seki, or treat it as a three step ko and make eyes. Either way, it's not easy.])
