(;B[hh]C[Yes it's true that the 'squares' on a go board are not actually square, but if you put enough rectangles together, couldn't you make a square? (are you confused yet?)])
(;B[ih]C[Correct! Each 'square' is actually a rectangle, but put 12 x 13 together and it will usually be a square (some go boards may be different but by process of elimination you should have still picked this answer)  To find the number of squares, just multiply 19-12 by 19-13, which equals 42.RIGHT])
