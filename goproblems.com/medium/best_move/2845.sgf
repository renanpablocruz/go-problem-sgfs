(;B[ji]C[This move, 127 in the game, is arguably the most famous move in the history of Japanese go. On seeing this move Gennan's ears flushed red. A sign that he had been upset and might not have seen this move coming. Black 127 might not immediately give Black the lead on the board but psychologicaly it must have been a heavy blow. It expands Blacks moyo at the top, erases much of White's influence on the right, offers assistance to the four black stones below and aims at invading the left side. It radiates influence all over the board.  If White answers at A, Black B nicely links up all his stones. If E, Black invades at F. The four stones are now too small to worry about. In the game Gennan exchanged I for J before playing K. In retrospect Gennan should have played at Z before playing the marked move.RIGHT]LB[ji:1]LB[in:A]LB[jl:B]LB[ji:1]LB[jo:E]LB[ci:F]LB[ji:1]LB[eb:I]LB[fb:J]LB[eg:K]TR[io]LB[ih:Z]MN[1])
