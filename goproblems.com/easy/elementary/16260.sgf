(;B[kj];W[kk]C[Wrong! Black is solidly connected with two eyes, therefore alive, but you could have secured more territory. The triangle point is a dame point, and does not count as territory for either side.]MA[ik]MA[nk]TR[lk])
(;B[kk];W[kj]MA[ik]MA[nk]C[Correct! Black is alive with three points of territory. Even though the two black chains are not solidly connected, the triangle point is still black territory and secures life for the two chains.RIGHT]TR[lk])
(;B[lk]C[];W[kj]MA[ik]MA[nk]TR[kk]C[This is the worst of the three possible moves. You have only two points of territory (squares), and you still need to spend a move at the triangle to save the groups.]))
