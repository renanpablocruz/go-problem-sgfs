Start at 'A'.FORCE]AP[goproblems];W[qe]C[Unfortunatly, the CHOICE tag, only allows, 2 branches, so bR14, won't be played automatically by the applet... Although R14 is such a nice move - It asks to have the right side... And go is a game of sharing - You give som, take some... And try to get just slightly more to win... But we won't have white's decision shown by the applet... :(]
