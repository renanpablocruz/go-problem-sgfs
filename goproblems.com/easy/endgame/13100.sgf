(;W[if]C[Correct.  Once again, the game depends on the state of the lower right corner.  However, this time, if white decides to fill in liberties, black can sacrifice his four stones in the corner by playing triangle.  After this, if white continues to fill in liberties, black can create a seki by playing both of the points marked square.
