Wherether white choses to use 1,3,5 as ko threats or not, black will still have to capture the 4 white stones. So he has 4x2(prioners+ter under them) + 1(the ter at k12) = 9 moku. If black went at A he'd have 4x2(prioners+ter under them) + 5(k11, k12,l12,m12,n12 ter) = 13 moku. The difference is 4. (As karmaGfa mentions in the comments - 'black in A is gote while white in A is sente for the capturing race.
