(;W[nb]C[White gets 1 point in sente (if Black defends at P18), 2 points in gote (if white tenukies first but defends if White continues at P18), 3 points in double gote (if White responds to Q18) or 5 points in quadruple gote (if White does not respond at all). So for White to tenuki is less costly than in the other path, hence B is better.])
(;W[nd]C[Correct. Compared to Black defending at O16 at the end of the game White gets 1 point in sente (if Black defends at P16), 2 points in gote (if white tenukies first but defends if White continues at P16) or 5 points in triple gote (if White does not respond at all). Taking sente costs White more than in the other path.RIGHT]))
