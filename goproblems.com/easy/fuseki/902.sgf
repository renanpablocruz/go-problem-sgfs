C[An invasion at A would be preferable 
for White, as long as Black doesn't 
have a stone around the top hoshi 
(star-point). The idea being that, if 
Black takes away White's base on one 
side, White can either look forward to 
getting a stone in at C which is the 
weak spot of the black corner, or 
having an easier base with D as it is 2 
points away from the black top.]
