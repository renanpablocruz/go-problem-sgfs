(;B[pe]C[Correct Answer.  Black 1 is the famous diagonal move of Honinbo Shusaku. It is a solid move and White will have a hard time equalising. In Shusaku's time, however, games were played without a komi, but today a 6.5-point komi is given White as compensation for her playing second. For that reason, Black 1 is considered to be a bit passive, so nowadays professionals usually make a pincer around A.  <= RIGHT]LB[ld:A])
