C[And after Black plays the usual pincer 
around S, White has various moves 
(G,H,J,K for example) with which to 
annoy Black, as he is a little too thin.  
Simply playing at L or M or N is also an 
option though.]

invading at A, settling himself with B or 
when he gets a stone in at Q invading 
at D or E.]
