(;W[np]C[Correct. Black cannot immediately play n5 and so the triangled stones are free. Black can follow up in sente with o6 forcing white n5; however, if black should choose to capture the squared stones it would be in gote and would not necessarily be black's strongest play, particularly if there are bigger plays on the rest of the board. Essentially for white the triangled stones now have local influence and are not under risk of capture.RIGHT]TR[kn]TR[ko]TR[kp]TR[lo]MA[ml]MA[nl])
