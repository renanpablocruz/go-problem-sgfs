C[Black's best move?]
(
;
B[ns]
C[A white play here would start a ko for this entire group and both white and black have a local ko-threat (T6/S5 for black and L1 for white). RIGHT]
)
(
;
B[db]
C[Takes some territory but black has a group in danger. C18 would be better since white can't cut at D18 due to aji of D17 followed by C16.]
)
(
;
B[eo]
C[Gote so white can erase gains at C6.]
)
(

B[bk]
C[White can connect at A9 and needn't worry about cutting points above yet.]
)
(
;
B[cb]
C[Takes territory but black has a group in danger. Note white can't cut at D18.]

B[gs]
C[Sente due to weakness at L1 (otherwise black has J1 then L1) but there is a larger move.]
)

B[fh]
C[Stops white reducing with F11 but there is a more urgent move for black.]

B[pf]
C[A couple points in gote.]

B[ja]
C[Gote.]

B[ks]
C[Sente due to weakness at G1 (otherwise black has J1 then G1) but there is a more urgent move.]
