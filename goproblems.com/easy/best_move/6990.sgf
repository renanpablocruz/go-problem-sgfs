(;W[jj]LB[jj:T]C[Without knowledge of the rest of the board, it's impossible to say which of tenuki, A, or B is correct.  However, the number of situations where tenuki is incorrect are small.  Tenuki is only incorrect when B has just taken a small ko, and winning that ko is the biggest move.  In that case W needs to use C5 as a threat.  Tenuki is however not wrong in the case where w has just taken the ko, and there is nothing else bigger.  In that case, the best tenuki will be to fill the ko, and the game will be over.In contrast, the moves A and B have lots of situations where they're wrong.  When the value of a move elsewhere is greater than 1, B will just ignore A or B.RIGHT])
(;W[co]C[This is a 1 point gote move.  If there is anything bigger on the board, b will tenuki.  If not, b will d2, and you have removed a threat.  In most situations this is not the best move.  If there is a small ko on the board, this could be a good threat.  However, without knowledge of who a ko will favor when threats are reduced to the 1 point level, such a ko is equally likely to occur for either player, it's impossible to say whether it's better to save a threat for yourself, or remove one for the opponent.  If later there is a small ko favoring B, c5 will have been a mistake for w, since he will no longer have that threat.RIGHT]AB[dj]AB[cj]AB[bj]AB[aj]AW[ak]AW[bk]AW[ck]AW[dk]AB[ek]AB[ei]AB[fj]AW[fk]AW[el]AW[dl]AW[fl]AW[cm]AW[bm]AW[am]AW[hl]AW[hm]AW[hn]AW[gk]AW[hk]AB[gj]AB[di]AB[fi]AB[hj]AB[hi])
(;W[dr]C[This is a 1 point gote move.  If there is anything bigger on the board, b will not c5, and this will have been a bad move.  If not, b will c5, and you have removed a threat.

However, without knowledge of who a ko will favor when threats are reduced to the 1 point level, such a ko is equally likely to occur for either player, so it's impossible to say whether it's better to save a threat for yourself, or remove one for the opponent.  If later there is a ko as shown, having done D2 earlier will have been a good move for w, since it removes a threat from B.  That is providing that W plays d2 at a point when there's nothing bigger on the board, so B answers.  However, the opposite ko situation is just as likely to occur.RIGHT]AW[is]AW[ir]AW[iq]AW[ip]AW[io]AW[in]AB[jl]AB[jn]AB[jo]AB[jp]AB[jq]AB[jr]AB[js]AB[jk]AB[kk]AW[il]AW[hl]AW[hm]AW[hn]AB[km]AW[jm]AB[kn])
