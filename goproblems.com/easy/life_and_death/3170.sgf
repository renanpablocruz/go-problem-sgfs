(;B[so];W[sp]LB[rp:a]LB[rn:b]C[ White captures, and the Ko rule prevents Black from recapturing as that creates the same position as before. So Black must find a Ko-threat (like trying to escape at Q5). If White answers the threat (P5) then Black can recapture at a, then ignore any White Ko-threat (assuming one is played) and play at b for sweet, sweet life.RIGHT])
