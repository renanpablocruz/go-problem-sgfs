C[RIGHT Believe it or not. Actually, the variations are very straightforward from here. black can capture the two stones, but it doesn't help him. The reason I didn't add any variations is, that there are so many useless black move combinations from here. I think the japanese call this striking tesuji 'patting the racoon's belly'.]
