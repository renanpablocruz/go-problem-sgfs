(;B[ar];W[br]C[oh no! this is so mean of white.  don't worry though -- anybody could make this mistake!])
(;B[cr];W[ar]C[this is a very intelligent try! but, i think it might be incorrect.]
(;B[br];W[bs]C[oh no! atari!];B[as];W[bs]C[sadly -- white can retake at b1.  it was a very good of you to read so far, and miss only such a subtle move!])
(;B[bs];W[br]C[the space at c1 is called a 'false eye'.  these are very sneaky! eventually w can atari at a1, and then capture, and kill black. false eyes are very tricky -- don't feel bad! you did good!]))

(;B[cr];W[bs]C[oh no! atari!];B[as];W[bs]C[oh . . . this was so close! please, try again and just change one move! you are very strong!]))
(;B[bs];W[br];B[cr];W[ar]C[oh no! the space at c1 is a 'false eye' -- which is not a real eye.  still -- you are very good to get 1.5 out of two eyes!]))
