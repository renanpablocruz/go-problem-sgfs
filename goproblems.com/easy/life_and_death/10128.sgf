But that just adds more ko threats =( PLUS black can just dive right into your territory with d13, taking at least a good 8~10 points, depending on how solid the mid-left side is. This SHOULD be wrong, in fact, but since this is a L&D problem and not an endgame one, I'll let you slide for now.RIGHT]))
