Problems from Qi Jing Zhong Miao
===============

Taken from UliGo Website.

These are 85 out of several hundred problems in the Qi Jing Zhong Miao (Japanese: Gokyo Shumyo, Korean: Ki Kyung Joong Myo) collection. The problem diagrams without solutions are available as text files on the Flygo website. I added solutions and refutations of certain wrong answers to these problems, so that they can be used with uliGo.

The level of the problems varies, but I think that the problems should be useful for most kyu players, and maybe (for doing lots of easy problems fast) for low dan players. (If you think that this estimate is wrong, please let me know.)

Since I added the solutions to these problems myself, probably some errors crept in. Mainly, in some problems alternative correct solutions might be missing. If you find any mistake, please drop me a line: u@g0ertz.de.

See below for the other problems from the Qi Jing Zhong Miao collection in SGF format.
